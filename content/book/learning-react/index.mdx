## Chapter 4 "How React Works"

## Feb 2nd 7pm

## Chapter 5 - React with JSX (React Elements as JSX, Babel, Recipes as JSX, React Fragments).

Using the cdns\* and the script type=“text/babel”, recreate the Delicious Recipes code using another fake - or real - dataset (array) and share your code with the group. i.e. School Names, Addresses and Programs; Cars names, prices and available colours; etc.

We’ll notice that the process of looping through data - or consuming data from an API - and rendering UI is basically the same despite of the industry of the app (Food, Cars, Educational, Hotels, BnB, Movies, etc).
